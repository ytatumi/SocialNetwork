SUGGESTED ADDED / MODIFIED FUNCTIONALITY

CLI
0: Create New User >> without setting new user as the new currentUser [Niklas]
3: (RegularUser) Like a post >> Modify functionality to offer option to like/unlike a post [Joakim]
5: Change User >> Modify to implement user credentials (email) [Begaiym]
6: (ModUser) Delete a reported post [Yuka]
7: (ModUser) Accept a reported post [Yuka]

BUG Review and modify use of recursion for SocialNetwork changeUser and createNewUser

New option: (ModUser) Report a user [Anthony]
New option: (ModUser) Accept a reported user [Anthony]

REFACTOR: SocialNetwork and specifically the selection menu
 - Cleaner method for displaying the menu (and sub menus)
 - Organizing individual Menu actions into separate classes

OPTIONAL EXPANSION

Classes:

PostBoard implements Reportable
 + subject, posts
ReportedPost extends Post
 + post, reporters, status, moderator
ReportedUser extends User
 + reporters, status, moderator
ReportedBoard extends PostBoard
 + reporters, status, moderator
